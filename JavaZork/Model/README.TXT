My game is called Legend Of The Hangover: Chunder Of the Wild
It is based on legend of Zelda breath of the wild but with a twist.
It contains a simple gui with changing images. 
You type commands into a terminal such as 
go <direction>
talkto <npc>
take <item>
drop<item> 
and much more which you can find in the game.
